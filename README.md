Django Task #3 (REST API)

Build 2 Django REST API backend endpoints that will log in the user with 2 different methods:

●Regular login with email and password
●Login via FB Connect or Google OAuth method. Please, if possible avoid ready-to-use Django addons for 3rd party logins.

We don’t need any UI, forms, and login pages.

Just end points that will double-check received user data, check with the database or external resource if it’s valid, and open user session. And finally, give back auth token.

You can use the default Django User model for this task.
